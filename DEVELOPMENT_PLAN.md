- **API endpoint protection** in all Supabase Edge Functions

### Data Validation & Integrity
- **Double validation**: Frontend (Zod) + Backend (Edge Functions)

- **Type safety** enforced through TypeScript and Supabase types
- **File validation**: Only PDF, DOCX, TXT for document uploads

### Task Management
- **Async processing** for long-running tasks (scraping, embeddings)
- **Batch operations** to respect API rate limits
- **Progress tracking** for all multi-step operations
- **Graceful interruption** of ongoing processes

### AI & RAG Implementation
- **Context-first responses** using project-specific embeddings
- **Quality thresholds** with iterative refinement
- **Memory management** for conversation continuity
- **Content type filtering** for focused responses

### Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Graceful degradation** when services fail
- **Comprehensive logging** in Edge Functions
- **User-friendly error messages** via toast system
- **Retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff

### Scalability & Performance
- **Rate limiting** on resource-intensive operations
- **Caching strategies** using React Query
- **Database indexing** for frequent queries
